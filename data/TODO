Animation Thoughts:
  - Both return a promise, we await both of them, that keeps them in sync?
  - Keep a 'global' object of timeline shapes, these are objects with positions
  - When you add a new timeline box, add it to this shapes object and animate all existing ones down

Animation thoughts Pt 2:
  - When we loop the aggregated temps instead of drawing them, we need to construct
    - object of (x0,x1,y0,y1,width,height)
  - Now that we have all our 'intented animations' we can loop where we 
    - draw axis, draw 'frame' of all boxes, sleep, clear
